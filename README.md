# MontezumaRevenge_SDRL
This is for the project "SDRL: Interpretable and Data-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning Leveraging Symbolic Planning".

launch_training_session.sh is used for the training process, while launch_test.sh is for the test.

Requirement: Tensorflow and Keras (the experiments were run on Tensorflow version 1.3.0 and Keras version 2.1.2)
